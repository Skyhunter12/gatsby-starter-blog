> 1 : What is cost 💸 ?
 -1.5 billion ( ISRO Rs. 788.00 Cr and JPL’s USD 808 million.)
 - It has SweepSAR technique - More swath of about 200km wide and resolution of 5-10m.
 - Crop Identification and Monitoring:
 - Soil Moisture Estimation:
 - Flood Inundation Mapping:
 - Timely Information for Decision Making:
 - Complementary Data (Existing optical Image data)
 - NASA's Earthdata portal : https://lnkd.in/gqHgcM2k & ISRO's Bhoonidhi portal : https://lnkd.in/gqrze4ds
 - NISAR S-band data will be downlinked by ISRO ground stations while the L-band data co-located with S-band will be transferred from NASA ground stations to ISRO 
 - 3 months from today

🚀 **A New Milestone for Space & Earth Observation!**

Today marks a historic collaboration between #NASA 🇺🇸 and #ISRO 🇮🇳 with the launch of the **NISAR Satellite**! 🌍🛰️

### 💸 1. What is the Cost?
- **Total:** $1.5 billion
- **ISRO:** ₹788.00 Cr
- **NASA/JPL:** $808 million

---

### 🛰️ 2. Why NISAR?
- Utilizes **SweepSAR** technology for a wide 200km swath and 5-10m resolution.
- Combines NASA's **L-band** and ISRO's **S-band** radars for detailed, simultaneous observation of Earth's surface and subsurface.
- Enables advanced **polarimetric** and **interferometric** techniques.

---

### 🌀 3. What are Polarimetric & Interferometric Techniques?
- Analyze surface characteristics and subtle changes over time.
- Help us better understand hazards like **earthquakes** and **volcanic eruptions** 🌋.

---

### 📊 4. Project Details
- **Orbit Altitude:** 747 km
- **Inclination:** 98.4°
