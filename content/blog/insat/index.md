## 🛰️What is INSAT program? ##
- **Cutting-edge Technology:**  
- The Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is one of the largest domestic communication satellite systems in Asia-Pacific region with nine operational communication satellites placed in Geo-stationary orbit. Established in 1983 with commissioning of INSAT-1B, it initiated a major revolution in India’s communications sector and sustained the same later.

- The INSAT system with more than 200 transponders in the C, Extended C and Ku-bands provides services to various sectors
