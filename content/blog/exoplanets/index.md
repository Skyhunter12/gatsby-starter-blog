An exoplanet is any planet beyond our solar system. Most of them orbit other stars, but some free-floating exoplanets, called rogue planets, are untethered to any star. NASA confirmed nearly 6,000 exoplanets, out of the billions that we believe exist.

## 🪐 How Do We Find Exoplanets?

There are **5 main ways** astronomers discover planets beyond our solar system:

- **🌊 Radial Velocity – Watching for Wobble**  
  *1133 planets discovered*  
  By observing tiny shifts in a star’s motion caused by the gravitational pull of orbiting planets.

- **🌑 Transit – Searching for Shadows**  
  *4438 planets discovered*  
  By detecting dips in a star’s brightness when a planet passes in front of it.

- **📸 Direct Imaging – Taking Pictures**  
  *84 planets discovered*  
  By capturing actual images of exoplanets using powerful telescopes.

- **🔍 Gravitational Microlensing – Light in a Gravity Lens**  
  *253 planets discovered*  
  By observing how a planet’s gravity bends and magnifies the light from a distant star.

## 🚀 Moving from Earth to Mars Using Lagrange Points

Lagrange points are special positions in space where the gravitational forces of two large bodies (like Earth and the Sun) and the orbital motion of a spacecraft balance out. These points can be used as "rest stops" or transfer stations for interplanetary travel.

---

### 🛰️ Step-by-Step Journey

1. **Launch from Earth**  
   Begin your journey by launching a spacecraft from Earth.

2. **Travel to Earth-Sun Lagrange Point (L1 or L2)**  
   Move to a stable Lagrange point, which acts as a staging area for interplanetary missions.

3. **Transfer Orbit to Mars**  
   From the Lagrange point, perform a transfer maneuver (such as a Hohmann transfer) to set your trajectory toward Mars.

4. **Arrive at Mars-Sun Lagrange Point**  
   As you approach Mars, use its Lagrange points to enter Mars’ gravitational influence efficiently.

5. **Transfer to Mars’ Moons (Phobos or Deimos)**  
   Use Mars-moon Lagrange points to move between Mars and its moons with minimal energy.

### 🌌 Why Use Lagrange Points?

- **Low-energy transfers:** Reduce fuel consumption for course corrections.
- **Staging areas:** Assemble, refuel, or redirect spacecraft.
- **Gateway to moons:** Easily move between planet and moons using their Lagrange points.

---

### 🗺️ Example Route

- Earth → Earth-Sun L1 → Mars-Sun L1 → Mars → Phobos

---

### 📚 Real-World Applications

- The **James Webb Space Telescope** is stationed at Earth-Sun L2.
- Future Mars missions may use Lagrange points for efficient staging and fuel savings.
